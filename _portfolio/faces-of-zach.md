This website was inspired by [fillmurray.com](https://www.fillmurray.com/).
It was made as an inside joke, but I decided to keep it around.

## How To Use

You can get a placeholder image staring me by going to a url in this format `http://www.facesofzach.com/image/[width]/[height]`.

i.e. [http://www.facesofzach.com/image/200/300](http://www.facesofzach.com/image/200/300)

Images are cached, so images will not be different until the size changes.
