[Faith Promise Church](https://faithpromise.org/) was looking for a solution to stream and watch their sermons on the Fire TV.

I volunteered my time and worked to create the initial prototype application to fit their needs.

The application uses the [Ember](http://www.emberjs.com) framework.

It is still a work a progress, and a "dummy" version of the application can be seen [here](https://faithpromise.github.io/faith-promise-fire-tv-app/).
